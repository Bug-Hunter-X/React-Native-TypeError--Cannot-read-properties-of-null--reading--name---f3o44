This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or when components render before data is available.

```javascript
// Example: Accessing a property of a null or undefined object
const user = null; // Or undefined
const userName = user.name; // TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')
```
