# React Native TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications and provides a solution.

## Problem

The `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')` error arises when your code attempts to access a property of an object that is currently `null` or `undefined`. This frequently happens when dealing with asynchronous operations or when components render before the necessary data has loaded.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully handling potential `null` or `undefined` values before attempting to access their properties. This usually involves optional chaining (`?.`) or nullish coalescing (`??`)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd react-native-null-error`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the app: `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`
